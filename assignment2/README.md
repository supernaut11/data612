# Assignment 2 Instructions

To execute the provided Python script, simply execute `python assignment2.py`. The accuracy metric will be printed once the convolutional neural network is trained and evaluated. You should receive a result similar to `accuracy = 87.25%`.

Some restrictions/disclaimers:
  * The development and test of this code used GPUs for training. Not all sources of randomness can be controlled for these hardware resources, so accuracy values observed may vary slightly from the reported value above.
  * The script requires an internet connection to download the IMDB data set.
  * A constant random seed is used, so you should get the same result for every execution of the assignment code.
  * The train/test split used in the assignment is the default train/test split provided by the IMDB data set.
